LXterminal is a VTE-based terminal emulator with support for multiple tabs. 
It is completely desktop-independent and does not have any unnecessary 
dependencies. In order to reduce memory usage and increase the performance 
all instances of the terminal are sharing a single process.

LXterminal-clicky adds the ability to click on filenames in your terminal and
have them open in a vim server.

To install, make install lxterminal as normal, and then copy click-to-open to
your path.

You may want to customize click-to-open.

Patches welcome.
